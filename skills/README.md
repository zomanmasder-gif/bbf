## How to use

Paste to your AI (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, …):

```
Read this skill and use it: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsalmn/extremerouter/refs/heads/master/skills/extremerouter/SKILL.md
```

Then ask normally — *"generate an image of a cat"*, *"transcribe this URL"*, etc.

## Configure your shell once

```bash
export NINEROUTER_URL="http://localhost:20128"   # local default, or your VPS / tunnel URL
export NINEROUTER_KEY="sk-..."                   # from Dashboard → Keys (only if requireApiKey=true)
```

Verify: `curl $NINEROUTER_URL/api/health` → `{"ok":true}`.
